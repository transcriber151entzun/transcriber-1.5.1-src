<H2>Main features</H2>

<H4>Transcriptions</H4>

<UL>
<LI>management of several layers of segmentation: basic segmentation for
orthographic transcription (e.g. at each sentence or at each breathing),
speech turn segmentation (new speaker) and section segmentation (new topic...);
these 3 layers are hierarchically embeded. A 4th segmentation in background
acoustic conditions is also available</LI>

<LI>display of segmentations under the signal and in the text editor; display
of each segmentation under the signal can be toggled with a contextual
menu</LI>

<LI>always synchronize the cursors in the text editor window and in the
signal window:&nbsp;as soon as the cursor moves in one window, it is moved
in the other one and appears within the same segment</LI>

<LI>easy creation of the basic segmentation by the way of successive insertions
of boundaries at current cursor position, even during playback</LI>

<LI>move segment boundaries with the mouse</LI>

<LI>insert mark of change in background acoustic condition (music, speech,
other) at current cursor position in the signal</LI>

<LI>indicate some boundaries as the beginning of a new speech turn or of
a new section</LI>

<LI>edition of turns, sections or background conditions with a mouse clic
on the corresponding button in the editor, including possible destruction</LI>

<LI>management of a speaker list with a precise description of each (name,
type, accent...), further modification of its characteristics, research
of turns involving a specific speaker, importation of speakers from another
transcription</LI>

<LI>in the same way, management of a list of topics, find sections about
a topic, import topics from another file</LI>

<LI>specific management of overlapping speech with marks for each speaker
in the text editor</LI>

<LI>insert predefined events (noise, pronouciation mark, lexical mark,
language change) which can be instantaneous or be at the beginning or the
end of the event; user defined display of events (font, color, format);
edit or remove with a single clic on the event in the text</LI>

<LI>standard text edition features: cut/copy/paste, find/replace, (very
limited) undo</LI>

<LI>glossary for predefined words or expressions</LI>

<LI>transcriptions in XML&nbsp;format for easier automatic processing and
exchange; syntaxic validation of files upon their DTD</LI>

<LI>user-chosen encoding is used for transcriptions input/output; most
current encodings (ISO-8859-*, EUC-JP...) and Unicode (UTF-8)&nbsp;can
be used</LI>

<LI>when opening a file, automatic research of corresponding sound file;
if none is found, user is being asked to locate it.</LI>

<LI>import .typ transcriptions in .typ format and various labelling (xwaves,
OGI...); export to .typ and .stm</LI>

<LI>periodic automatic backup</LI>

<LI>keep previous version in backup file</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Sound management</H4>

<UL>
<LI>read most standards audio formats (thanks to Snack library)</LI>

<LI>handle long duration audio files (up to several hours) - for duration
over 30 sec., a low-resolution view of the signal is computed in background
and stored for speeding up later display</LI>

<LI>direct access to any position in the signal; selection of part of the
signal</LI>

<LI>synchronized cursor during playback</LI>

<LI>several playback modes through keyboard combinations:&nbsp;play/pause,
play the current segment, the selection, around the cursor</LI>

<LI>interactive change in resolution without stopping playback</LI>

<LI>able to display two views of the signal at different resolutions</LI>

<LI>vertical zoom</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Other features</H4>

<UL>
<LI>display cursor position (also during playback), selection width and
other messages under the signal</LI>

<LI>monitoring of user's productivity during the session</LI>

<LI>information window about the signal (filename, duration, format), about
the transcription (number of segments, of words...) et optionnaly of the
amount of work in the current session</LI>

<LI>edit the list of predefined events (noise, pronounciation...)</LI>

<LI>edit keyboard shortcuts for insertion of characters or strings (including
events)</LI>

<LI>font and colors user editable</LI>

<LI>easy localization in any language (English and French provided)</LI>

<LI>possible backup of the current state in a configuration file for use
in the next session: open files, options, window position</LI>
</UL>
