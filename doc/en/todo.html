<H2>To do list</H2>

<P>We develop Transcriber primarilly for Broadcast News, and do not commit
to developments for other purposes. However, we are willing to take into
account user needs, and to coordinate developments made by contributors.</P>

<H4>Things we are doing or plan to do</H4>

<P>Transcriber is under ongoing development. You can expect the following
improvements in future versions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Switch to a new transcription format based on annotation graphs, in
order to increase flexibility.</LI>

<LI>Enhanced glossary management and automatic completion while typing
in.</LI>

<LI>When creating a speaker, access speakers from other transcription files.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Things users have asked for</H4>

<P>Some (potential) users have expressed the need for the following functions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Dump the transcription as plain text or as postscript.</LI>

<LI>Spectrogram display.</LI>

<LI>Pitch extraction and display.</LI>

<LI>Playback speed control (slower than real time for detailed transcription,
faster than real time for scanning).</LI>

<LI>Manage many small signal files rather than a single big file.</LI>

<LI>Manage video in addition to sounds.</LI>

<LI>auto saving of backup transcription in a separate thread/forked
process.</LI>
</UL>

<P>We might implement some of these functions ourselves if we have time,
but contributions will be welcomed!</P>

<P>If you would like an additional request to appear in the above list,
please send a message to <A HREF="mailto:transcriber-request@etca.fr">transcriber-request@etca.fr</A>.</P>
